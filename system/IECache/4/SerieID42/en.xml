  <Overview>From writer Robert Borden (The Drew Carey Show) and director Ken Kwapis (The Office) comes a comedy where cultural differences are a novelty.
Mid America Novelties sells products like whoopee cushions, foam fingers, and wallets made of bacon. Yes, this is the stuff upon which the American way of life is built, but try explaining that to someone who lives on the other side of the world.
Well, that's exactly what Todd Dempsy must do when he's sent to run the company's call center in India. Talk about culture shock, and not just for Todd's employees. While Todd has to teach them how to make the up-sell to the Deluxe Twin Beer Helmet, he's going to have to adapt as well. Like in a country where cows are sacred, perhaps you don't order a double cheeseburger.
Wish him luck. Or as they say in India, Saubhagya.</Overview>
