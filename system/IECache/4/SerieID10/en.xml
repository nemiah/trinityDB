  <Overview>New servant Cedric muscles in on Merlin's position as Arthur's right-hand man, and turns the prince against his loyal friend. Merlin is convinced the slippery newcomer is up to something, and he is right - Cedric is a conman and a thief who is after a magnificent jewel, recently unearthed in a tomb far beneath Camelot. Little does he know, his precious prize is more dangerous than he could possibly imagine.

Camelot has never been more vulnerable, but how can Merlin make things right when, thanks to Cedric, he might have lost Arthur's friendship for good? Merlin faces the prospect of turning to the one creature he swore he would never trust again - The Great Dragon.</Overview>

  <Overview>Lady Catrina and her strange servant Jonas arrive in Camelot, where they are welcome to stay by a most delighted king Uther, who becomes captivated by his latest guest. Arthur, on the contrary, far from sharing his father's enthusiasm and in the sight of the flirting going on, is pretty appalled with the situation. Merlin and Gaius have the feeling that she is not what she seems and their suspicions are proven true when Merlin discovers that Lady Catrina is a troll and that unfortunately, her intentions are far beyond the prize of a king's heart. Horrified, he reveals the truth to Arthur, who doesn't believe him. Merlin embarks in the task of proving the real nature of the woman while at the same time saving Uther from ruin and Camelot from fall. Will the young warlock be able to overcome the powerful magic of the troll before it's too late?</Overview>

  <Overview>In his determination to rule magic out of Camelot forever, Uther hires the services of Aredian, a terrifying witch hunter who is most feared due to the fact that he stops at nothing in the quest to uncover all and every kind of sorcery.
Even though no one is under direct suspicion, several people in Camelot are afraid that the witch hunter could see straight through them: Morgana is worried that Uther might have her executed and Gaius is concerned for the fate of Merlin and his own, since caring for the young warlock is considered crime and treason.
Will all three be able to escape a dreadful fate?</Overview>

  <Overview>With the help of the Great Dragon, Merlin manages to return to Camelot only to find out that is it on the verge of invasion: Morgause and Cenred have teamed up and plot against a weakened Uther. Cenred's initial reluctance is won over by the fact that they count on an ally within Camelot walls who will ensure the castle is taken. Uther is unable to rule which forces Arthur to step up front and defend the citadel agains Cenred's powerful army. With the help of Morgause and to make things worse, Morgana plays a deadly card and summons a skeleton army to wreak havoc within the castle walls. Camelot's fate rests once again on Arthur's shoulders and Merlin's magic as they fight in their own way to hold off both an army of the living and an army of the dead. Will they manage to succeed? </Overview>

  <Overview>Will Arthur be able to save Camelot from the evil Morgana? Morgana, newly crowned as Queen of Camelot, begins a reign of terrible evil over the innocent citizens of the kingdom. Counting on Morgause and her immortal army at her command all hope seems lost for Uther, who is forced to witness how his kingdom crumble under the unimaginable cruelty of his own daughter. Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Camelot, Arthur recovers his strength and plans a counter attack with the help of a few loyals at his side: Gwaine, Lancelot, Elyan and Percival. However, Merlin is aware that not even a skilful warrior like Arthur can defeat an immortal foe without magic. Will he be able to reclaim the great sword Excalibur from the Lake of Avalon in time to save the lives of those he cares the most about?</Overview>
